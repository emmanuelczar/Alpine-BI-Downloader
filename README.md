Alpine-BI-Downloader

This is a script I made to download and convert some files from a third party web app that my current company is using. 
I made this back when I was learning to use the requests library. 

This was supposed to be run at specific times of the day by using the time library but the version of
the code now has a manual button in the GUI for running functions. With this project I learned how to use 
pyinstaller and learned more about setting up virtual environments.
